			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a third year undergraduate student working towards my B.S. in Information Technology Management.  I've come to really enjoy ITM, because of the fact that this major is the hands on part of technology that I have always wanted to work on.  Whether its system administration, networking, or database management, turns out is not in the field of CS but in ITM.
