				<li>Discussed the price of contracts of various vendors, to get a better quote on attractions for an on-campus event at IIT</li>
				<li>By being placed in charge of fun on-campus event for students, MTCC Late NIITe, I was given the task of contacting and securing contracts with various vendors.  These vendors were to provide differenct games, attractions, and food items.  Due to budget constraints, not everything I wanted for the event was available and so I had to negotiate with each vendor to give us a better value for what we were ordering.</li>

				<li>As bakery manager customer complaints are to be taken to me.  When a customer htat had ordered a cake 2 weeks prior, cam in to find that the bakery has not finished the order, he became quite irate.  I noticed that the customer was beginning to insult one of the other employees in the bakery and so I walked over to see what was the problem.</li>
